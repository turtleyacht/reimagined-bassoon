Answer the question of whether we can generate a word-search by expressing a
board with the following variables, instead of the traditional multidimensional
array:

  A string to represent the letters used. Spaces indicate unused (and would be
  filled later).

  A string of numbers to track adjacency. A position in the middle would have
  eight (8) adjacent neighbors. A position in the corner would have three (3).

  A one-dimensional array of scalars to map combinations of occupied positions
  to eight bits, 0 to 255.

Well, also answer if we can ask questions of a position and get back useful
replies for filling in words.

A driver program to explore--and iterate on--the problem space.

Something to generate larger boards. Up-front initialization by hand is
cumbersome and error-prone.

In ANSI C (C89).

Toward a printable word-search, so HTML output most likely.
